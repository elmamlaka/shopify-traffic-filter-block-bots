## Introduction

Automating the process of blocking traffic from specific countries and malicious bots can save significant time and effort while enhancing the security of your Shopify store.

### Why Automating This Task Matters for Shopify Websites

- **Enhanced Security:** Bots and malicious users are blocked, preventing potential attacks or misuse of resources.
- **Better User Experience:** With unwanted traffic filtered out, legitimate users experience faster and more reliable access.
- **Reduced Overhead:** Automating traffic filtering reduces manual intervention and resource waste.
- **Compliance and Targeted Access:** Allows geo-restriction for targeted traffic, blocking visitors from regions like China.
